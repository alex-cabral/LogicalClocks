Folder storing the log files from five one-minute runs on three virtual machines.

The first line of the file includes the VM's ticks per second, the starting system time (from System.nano()), and the starting Logical Clock time (always 0).

Each run is in a separate zip file, with the log of each VM as a text file in the folder.
